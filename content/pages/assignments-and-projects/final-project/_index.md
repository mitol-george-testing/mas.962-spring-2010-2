For more information on the scope of final projects, see [Assigment 7: Final Project Proposal]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments-and-projects/final-project-proposal). The final project consists of two components, a presentation and written documentation.

### Presentation

Project presentations will happen during class Ses #27. Each team will have approximately 10 minutes for their presentation. The core of the presentation should be a demonstration of your project in action. You should also include a short discussion of your concept, design, and construction process. A dress form, pin-up board, and tables will be available.

The presentations will be open to the public. I'll invite the Media Lab community and all of our local guest speakers. Feel free to invite friends and colleagues. Light refreshments will be served.

### Documentation

Create a Web page that documents your project. Your page should include a description of the project, pictures of the construction process and completed project, and a discussion of your experience. If appropriate, create a short video of your project in action. Also include design drawings, electrical schematics, and source code where appropriate, and any slides you included in your presentation.
