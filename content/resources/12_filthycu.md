description: 'Hypothetically, if people were so rude and dirty as to bypass the opportunity
  to wipe their feet on the presented welcome mat, they would be alerted of their
  filth. Rather than rigging some sort of obnoxious alarm system, I decided to keep
  the punctuation simple with the text and amp it up through fancy script. A pedestal
  placed inside the doorway reading "please, take one" would display a stack of neatly
  folded satin handkerchiefs with one small word embroidered in the corner: "filthy." '
