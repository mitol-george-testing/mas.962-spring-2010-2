Make a piece of flexible nonwoven fabric at least 12"x12" (~30cm x 30cm) with some noteworthy characteristic. (An unusual blend of materials, interesting structural characteristics, embedded circuitry, special electrical properties,...?)

Create a page that documents your project, with pictures and a paragraph or two that describes your nonwoven and discusses how it was made.
